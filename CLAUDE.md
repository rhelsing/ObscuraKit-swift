# Claude Code Context

## Read this before changing anything

Read these first:

- [`obscura-proto/SPEC.md` §0 — The kit boundary](../obscura-proto/SPEC.md) — normative, and the
  section that decides every "should the kit do this?" argument.
- [`obscura-proto/KIT_API.md`](../obscura-proto/KIT_API.md) — the app-facing surface this kit
  implements: the inbox (§3), payload classification (§4), `send` (§5), the entry store (§8.1), and
  §9's rule that the entry store does not grow a query API.
- [`obscura-proto/HISTORY.md`](../obscura-proto/HISTORY.md) — non-normative
  migration history.

The current app-facing surface is
`client.send(to:modelKey:entryId:op:sentAt:payload:)`, the durable
`client.inbox`, and opaque `client.entries` storage. Merge, audience resolution,
schemas, queries, expiry, and notification policy live in `obscura-pix`.

`ObscuraSchema` owns additive database migrations. **Never edit an applied
migration; add a new one.**

The rule that governs this repo:

> **If the kit reads it, it is a field in `client.proto`.
> If it is not in `client.proto`, the kit MUST NOT read it.**

**Do not add an ORM, CRDT layer, query builder, audience/routing engine, or
schema parser.** Re-check `SPEC.md` §0 and the shipping app before expanding the
entry store beyond `KIT_API.md` §8.1.

## Current constraints

- No Notification Service Extension exists. Shared database, key, and session
  plumbing exists but is not device-verified; the current APNs payload cannot
  launch an NSE. See `docs/NSE_PREREQUISITES.md`.
- This kit sends `DEVICE_LINK_APPROVAL` but has no receive handler. The arm is
  logged, dropped, and acknowledged so it cannot wedge the queue. Kotlin handles
  it, so linked-device behavior differs by platform.
- Device announcements use a trust-on-first-use recovery key but have no replay
  protection. Timestamp ordering rejects stale state but is not a nonce.
- Linked devices receive the friend graph at link time but do not learn friends
  added later. `FRIEND_SYNC` is unsupported.
- There is no remote device revocation. Use `api.deleteDevice` from a device you
  still hold.
- `sendModelSync(to:model:entryId:op:data:)` is a legacy single-friend surface.
  Prefer explicit-audience `send(to:...)`.
- Legacy TEXT send/receive APIs remain source-level compatibility surfaces.
- `MODEL_SYNC` has one durable receive write: `inbox.put`. Persistence errors
  propagate and skip acknowledgement (`SPEC.md` §0.9).

`obscura-client-web` is a throwaway proof of concept, not a porting target or
normative implementation.

## Project Overview

ObscuraKit — the **native iOS platform layer** for the Obscura app (`obscura-pix`). Not a
general-purpose framework; it has one consumer and owes API stability to no one.

It exists natively because libsignal has no supported shared core and
background push processing cannot depend on a React Native runtime. Everything
else belongs in the app.

It must agree with ObscuraKit-Kotlin on the **wire** (`conformance/wire.json`) and nothing more.

## Server

- **API:** https://obscura.barrelmaker.dev
- **OpenAPI Spec:** https://obscura.barrelmaker.dev/openapi.yaml
- **Server Repo:** https://github.com/barrelmaker97/obscura-server

All smoke/scenario tests run against the live server.

### Rate Limits (per-instance, 3 instances load balanced)
- **General endpoints:** 10 req/s sustained, 20 req/s burst
- **Auth endpoints** (register, login, refresh): 1 req/s sustained, 3 req/s burst
- Use `await rateLimitDelay()` (100ms) between general calls
- Use `await authRateLimitDelay()` (1000ms) between auth calls
- Both configurable via `SERVER_REQUEST_DELAY_MS` and `AUTH_REQUEST_DELAY_MS` in `Constants.swift`

## Reference implementations

There is no porting reference. This kit is written against the contract in `obscura-proto`
(`SPEC.md` + `conformance/`), not against another codebase.

## Server API Quick Reference

### Auth Tokens
- **User-Scoped JWT:** From POST `/v1/users` or `/v1/sessions`. For device provisioning.
- **Device-Scoped JWT:** Includes `deviceId` claim. Required for messaging, keys, gateway.
- **Refresh Token:** Rotation invalidates old token. Use POST `/v1/sessions/refresh`.
- **WebSocket Ticket:** Single-use from POST `/v1/gateway/ticket`, pass as query param to `/v1/gateway`.

### Endpoints
```
POST   /v1/users                 Register (no auth, JSON)
POST   /v1/sessions              Login (no auth, JSON)

DELETE /v1/sessions              Logout (Bearer)

POST   /v1/devices               Provision device with keys (Bearer, JSON)

PUT    /v1/devices/{id}          Update device (Bearer)
DELETE /v1/devices/{id}          Delete device + cascade (Bearer)

POST   /v1/devices/keys          Upload prekeys / device takeover (Device-Scoped, JSON)
GET    /v1/users/{userId}        Fetch prekey bundles (Device-Scoped, JSON)

POST   /v1/gateway/ticket        Get WebSocket ticket (Device-Scoped)
GET    /v1/gateway               WebSocket connect (ticket query param, Protobuf frames)

POST   /v1/backup                Upload backup (Bearer, binary, ETag optimistic locking)

PUT    /v1/push-tokens           Register APNS/FCM token (Device-Scoped, JSON)
```

### Key Response Shapes

**AuthResponse:** `{ token, refreshToken, expiresAt, deviceId? }`

**PreKeyBundleResponse (from GET /v1/users/{userId}):**
```json
[{
  "deviceId": "uuid",
  "registrationId": 12345,
  "identityKey": "base64",
  "signedPreKey": { "keyId": 1, "publicKey": "base64", "signature": "base64" },
  "oneTimePreKey": { "keyId": 1, "publicKey": "base64" }
}]
```

**CreateDeviceRequest (POST /v1/devices):**
```json
{
  "name": "iPhone",
  "identityKey": "base64",
  "registrationId": 12345,
  "signedPreKey": { "keyId": 1, "publicKey": "base64", "signature": "base64" },
  "oneTimePreKeys": [{ "keyId": 1, "publicKey": "base64" }]
}
```

### Critical Implementation Notes
- `POST /v1/messages` requires `Idempotency-Key` header (UUID) and `Content-Type: application/x-protobuf`
- Device takeover: if `POST /v1/devices/keys` includes a different `identityKey`, server replaces all keys and disconnects existing sessions
- Backup uses optimistic locking: `If-None-Match: *` for initial upload, `If-Match: <etag>` for updates
- Signal keys: 33-byte public (0x05 prefix + 32 bytes), 32-byte private, 64-byte XEdDSA signatures

## Build & Test

```bash
./dev.sh build
./dev.sh test
./dev.sh test --filter CoreFlowTests
```

Native builds on macOS 13+. No Docker. `dev.sh` sets the Swift 6.1 toolchain and `LIBRARY_PATH` for libsignal FFI.
